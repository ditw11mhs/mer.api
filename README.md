MER.API - Medical Engineering Research API

Taken from Mount Merapi
(me-ra-pi)

Mount Merapi, Gunung Merapi, is an active stratovolcano located on the border between the province of Central Java and the Special Region of Yogyakarta, Indonesia. It is the most active volcano in Indonesia and has erupted regularly since 1548. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Merapi)

## What?
Medical Engineering Research API or MER.API is an Open Source API based platform that collect multiple medical or biomedical engineering related machine learning model while still honoring and citing the researcher doing the research. 

## How?
The current approach is to do the most minimalistic (maybe a bit naive) approach to get everything done. This project use Streamlit as Frontend, FastAPI as Backend, Docker to containeraze the app and Heroku to deploy. Props to the guy writing this [blog](https://testdriven.io/blog/fastapi-streamlit/) that initiate this approach , I don't know if he is the first that tought about this, but his blog is the first that I had read about using this approach.

## Why?
This project started due to the predicament the author had trying to search for biomedical engineering AI related paper, grasping the concept in the theory while diving deep down in the code. While some popular website such as https://paperswithcode.com may give a lot of good information and maintaining the balance between paper and code, I'm just not that bright to get everything sorted inside my head. The aim of this project is to make AI more approachable (not necessarily easy) for undergradute students or maybe some self taught guys out there (props to you guys) or anybody else by showing the model in action via the web app while still giving access to the API and more importantly citing the paper (maybe give some more explaination)

TL;DR I'm just not that bright with theory, and so with many others like me, so I made this platform to fill the gap betwwen theory and code regarding machine learning in medical or biomedical engineering

## Who?
I'm Aditya Wardianto, in the time of starting this project is a 5th Semester undergradute student taking Biomedical Engineering in Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology Indonesia, this project started at 26/09/2021 in the middle of the night, yeah I think I should sleep
